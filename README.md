# Running the game
The game is using SFML librabries in order to run the game you will have to link sfml libraries dynamically.
You can find tutorials how to do it here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/ in getting started section.

# Remarks 
The application is not finished yet.
If you want to develop your SFML skills you can try to fix window resizing, adjusting window's contents to it's size, improving quality of animations etc.
